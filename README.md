## Synopsis

* The main objective of this project is to create a model that predicts taxi demand around Manhattan and the airports region in New York City. 
* The demand is divided into three categories: High, Medium, and Low. The model will assign each region to one of the three categories on an hourly basis.
* One of the main focuses of the model is to accurately distinguish the high and medium-demand regions from the low-demand regions which would enable the taxicabs to focus on high-demand regions and avoid low-demand ones, thus improving efficiency and increasing profits.
* To explore the revenue (Fare) and cost (Duration and Distance) of each region to see if certain regions of the city are more profitable than others.
* To analyze the model performance to see how much loss was generated from the model's erroneous prediction.

### Note
MATLAB's "Classification Learner" app was utilized for model prediction.
